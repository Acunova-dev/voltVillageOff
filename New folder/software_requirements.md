# Software Requirements Specification Document

## System Design
- Modular and scalable design separating concerns (UI, business logic, data handling)
- Responsive system to support mobile-first design and desktop experiences
- Secure handling of transactions, user data, and communications

## Architecture Pattern
- Layered architecture (presentation, business logic, data access)
- Client-server model with clear separation between frontend and backend
- Service-oriented components to allow for future feature expansion

## State Management
- Centralized state management to handle user sessions, item listings, and real-time updates
- Local state management within components to optimize performance
- Clear strategies for synchronizing UI state with backend data

## Data Flow
- Unidirectional data flow from user actions on the frontend to the backend processing
- Event-driven updates for real-time notifications (e.g., bid updates, transaction status)
- Well-defined data pipelines for search, filtering, and listing operations

## Technical Stack
- Designed to be language agnostic with flexibility in technology choices
- Can be implemented using popular frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue)
- Backend can be built using any modern server-side framework (e.g., Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails)
- Integrates with third-party APIs for payments and messaging when needed

## Authentication Process
- Secure user registration and login with email verification
- Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for managing user sessions
- Optional OAuth integration for social logins
- Role-based access control to differentiate between buyers and sellers

## Route Design
- RESTful API routes corresponding to major functionalities:
  - **User Routes:** Register, login, profile management
  - **Listing Routes:** Create, read, update, delete item listings
  - **Bid/Request Routes:** Post, view, and manage bids/requests
  - **Transaction Routes:** Process payments, update shipping/delivery statuses
- Versioning support for future API enhancements

## API Design
- RESTful endpoints using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent JSON response format with standardized error messages
- Endpoints for:
  - User management (profiles, authentication)
  - Item listings and search functionality
  - Bidding/request processes
  - Transaction tracking and status updates
- Secure API endpoints using authentication tokens and role validations

## Database Design ERD
- **User**
  - Attributes: id, name, surname, email, phone number, gender, created_at, updated_at
- **Item Listing**
  - Attributes: id, user_id, photo_url, price, description, location, listing_status, created_at, updated_at
- **Request/Bid**
  - Attributes: id, buyer_id, item_id, bid_amount, bid_status, created_at, updated_at
- **Transaction**
  - Attributes: id, buyer_id, seller_id, item_id, payment_status, shipping_status, delivery_status, created_at, updated_at
- **Relationships:**
  - A User can have multiple Item Listings
  - An Item Listing can have multiple Bids/Requests
  - A Transaction links a Buyer, Seller, and an Item Listing
